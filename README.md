OpenWeatherSampleApp

Steps To Import:
1. Use clone link, to clone the app to your local machine.
2. Alternately, Import after downloading the project from your local machine using Android Studio.

About the App:

The app uses the 5 day weather forecast API of OpenWeatherMap. The API is consumed using hard coded lat, long coordinate values. The App uses Retrofit for network calls, a very basic list view with a card view as the list item. The App is made on MVP pattern. 


Functionalities which can be achieved with more time:
1. Use current location to provide weather forecast.
2. Instead of this very Basic UI, an interactive UI can be made.
3. Functionality can be added for search by City, to get weather forecast for the user searched city.
